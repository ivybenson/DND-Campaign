        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Demographics - Long before the age of Warlords, Otok was known as a
          good place for a fresh start, and a place of acceptance, and thus, is
          incredibly diverse. However, the two largest majorities are Gnomes
          (the original inhabitants of Otok) and Dwarves (as were very attracted
          to the new technologies). Many Deities are worshipped across the
          island as well, with the most common being Gond, the Lord of all
          Smiths. Also widely worshiped are Garl Glittergold, patron of Gnomes,
          Morodin, patron of Dwarves, and Silvanus, the Forrest Father.
          Followers of Silvanus generally wish to return Otok to a time before
          the Dawn of Steam, when the forests grew wildly, and are mostly
          nonviolent.

        <h2>Known History</h2>

        <p>
          Centuries ago, when the Island of Otok was whole, there was peace
          across the land. Each village mostly kept to itself, though travelers,
          traders, and merchants were welcomed throughout. Of course, disputes
          arose from time to time, generally being settled by the local lord
          with the most impressive personal army. And for a good long time, this
          was the way things went, and for a good long time, this worked. But as
          history has shown the world time and time again, all good things must
          come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 200 years ago, a new era of technology sprang to life: The Dawn
          of Steam. With the invention of the Steam Engine, new tools emerged to
          support and improve the lives of the people of Otok. And as new tools
          are built, so are weapons. Massive warring vehicles were constructed
          to crush anyone who opposed you, automatons were created to mindlessly
          slay those who stood in your way, and towering fortresses were erected
          to keep you safe from the madness outside. Before long, if you had not
          pledged yourself to serving a warlord, you were sure to be slaughtered
          in the crossfire.
        </p>
        <p>
          A gnome by the name of Orla Golub had enough of the destruction of her
          home island. She applied herself and learned all there was to know
          about these new technologies, and she built a forty foot tall
          automaton called the Ark of Justice. The Ark was humanoid in
          appearance, with each arm being weapons of ungodly destruction. She
          set out with her automatron to bring the gears of war that terrorized
          her homeland to a screeching halt. She marched across the island,
          taking down local warlords one by one, demolishing their compounds and
          wrecking their constructs. Before long, only two warlords remained:
          Snositi of the North and Lav of the South. Though bitter enemies,
          Snositi and Lav understood the reckoning that awaited them. They
          decided to join forces to destroy The Ark. They caught it at the
          center of the island, with one army approaching from the north, and
          one from the south.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orla Golub saw an opportunity to bring the bloodshed to a quick end,
          and decided to unleash the full, unrestricted power of the Ark of
          Justice. She commanded her automaton to aim one arm north, and one arm
          south, and to unleash a blast the likes of which the world had never
          seen. The blasts shot North and South, nearly annihilating both
          armies, and cutting the island in half except for the ground it stood
          on. The blast proved too powerful for the Ark to withstand, and it
          crumpled. Few survived this catastrophic event, but those who did
          managed to steal away with the arms of the Ark, though the Heart that
          powered them was never found. Most assume that it was destroyed by
          unleashing such power, while others believe Orla Golub knew that she
          must keep this power from the world, and she took it and hid it away.
          Either way, Orla was never seen again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orla wished to bring peace back to her home. However, her actions were
          so extreme that the island was literally divided. Two countries arose
          from the ashes of this campaign, one on the East, Istacno, and one on
          the West, Zapad.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though Orla Golub had destroyed every physical representation of the
          Warlord era, the ideologies lived on. As Otok was being rebuilt and
          re-established, these warlord idealists were overall shunned from the
          rest of society. An overwhelming amount of the population agreed that
          the past systems of Warlords constantly fighting for dominance and
          control was not beneficial to anyone but the Warlords themselves. Now,
          as the Warlords had been destroyed, the common people were able to
          rise and shape Otok as they saw fit. However, as Warlord Idealists
          were shunned from place to place, they eventually banded together and
          consolidated what power they still possessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          In establishing new systems of rule, the people found Otok to be too
          large to easily work together, and thus, two new countries were
          formed: Zapad (east) and Istacno (west) of the Union of Otok. The
          countries elected leaders and began to develop, supporting each other
          in whatever ways they could. Soon after the first election, the High
          Ministers of both countries met at Orla’s Stand, the bit of land that
          connects both countries, to embrace one another in a sign of unity.
          This was established as a new holiday called Zagrliti. Each year
          forward on Zagrliti the High Ministers of each country would meet at
          Orla’s Stand and share the traditional Embrace of Unity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the 150th year of the union, trouble was brewing within Istacno. A
          movement of Warlord Idealists known as the Warbears was growing
          rapidly in size. Istacno had elected a new High Minister, Medved the
          Red, a dwarf who had sworn to stomp out the Warbears and they’re
          destructive ways. However, soon after his election, Medved had a
          change of heart, and decided that the way of Istacno and the Union of
          Otok was not to oppose, but to accept. He now pledged to mend the
          divide between the country and the Warbears, and find peace, and began
          to praise some of the Warbear’s actions and uplifted them as
          outstanding patriots.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the 151st Zagrliti, Medved the Red met with Nissa Turen, the High
          Minister of Zapad, at Orla’s Stand for the Embrace of Unity. Post
          embrace, Medved proposed his idea for a Museum to showcase artifacts
          and relics from the Warlord Era in Forge, the capital of Istacno. He
          suggested that Zapad bring them the Arm of the Ark that they
          possessed, so that they could display the two arms together. Turen was
          concerned by this, and expressed her belief that this was widely
          unsafe. Medved quickly became angry, and the two argued extensively.
          As Turen gave her final “no” and turned to walk away, Medved drew a
          handaxe and drove it into Turen’s back, killing her.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was the turning point between the two nations. Fueled by his
          desire to possess both Arms of the Ark, he attempted to change Istacno
          into a nation of Warlords once more. He now works in endless pursuit
          of the Heart of the Ark, in attempts to power the Arm he does have so
          that he may claim the other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Istacno now exists in a state of turmoil, full of Warbears trying to
          return the state to the old ways, as well as rebels, fighting to
          restore justice and peace. Zapad still ultimately remains peaceful,
          though the worries of war are prevalent. The border between the two
          nations is heavily guarded.
