          <h3>The Beginning: A Delivery at Shiphome</h3>
          <p>
With the sun high in the Zapad sky, the massive steel gates of the Shiphome Industrial Channel (aka the SIC) swing open for the Tidebreaker, a delivery ship that traverses back and forth between Zapad and the distant continent of Daleka. Smaller tugboats pull the beaten and busted up Tidebreaker into the SIC toward the Yard, the heart of Shiphome. </p> 
<p>As they move down the SIC, they pass a small group of protesters from the College of Natural Studies in Treewatch. They yell angrily at the crewmembers and wave their signs: “Clean up the SIC,” “The SIC pours pollution into the ocean,” “The SIC makes me wanna puke,” etc. As the Tidebreaker docks, a small crowd gathers to collect their packages and deliveries. The Tidebreaker’s Captain, a dwarf named Grennel, happily reports that there were no pirate attacks this voyage, and all items are accounted for. A sigh of relief passes over the crowd, as the Tidebreaker is the cheapest and least secure ship to do business with. About 45 percent of it’s voyages encounter pirates, and without the means to defend against them, most of the cargo gets stolen.</p> 
<p> All around the Yard, cranes and powered carts move about, a typically busy day for Shiphome. Many shiphands can be seen heading from their boats to Rumtown, a small stretch of business at the southern edge of the Yard made mostly of liquor stores, taverns, breweries, and other alcoholicly driven businesses. Today, an unusually high amount of religious groups are out and about, handing out literature to coming and going passengers and preaching about the glories of their deities. Plenty of guards and private security can be seen hanging about, as well as plenty of individuals who seem to be on the other side of the law. All these and more make up the bustling city of Shiphome, the Largest Port City in Otok.</p>
